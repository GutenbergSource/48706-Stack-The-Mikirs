<HTML><BODY>The Mikirs are a tribe that live in the North-Easter part of India.

<p>For most part this book is just a run-of-the mill anthropological work, with some tables, and accented characters, including macrons and breves, which should be handled according to the guidelines. (e.g. an o with macron becomes [=o], and an e with breve [)e]; for the accented characters in the dropdown menus, such as ó or ò, we of course use the character itself, not this notation.)

<p>The later half of this book contains a lot of bilingual text, set in parallel lines. To make this workable during PP, please add an extra line between each pair of lines (So you get a Mikir language line, then an English literal translation line, and then the extra empty line)

<p>During the F-rounds, please also add a bar symbol to separate each word or word group in the lines, such that the Mikir and English can be kept aligned, but there is no need to mark italics in those lines, so the end result will be like:

<pre>
"Ch[=i], | phàk-lèng [=a]lop[=o], | kopi nàng cheplàng-m[=a]? | Tov[=a]r
"Oh,     | wild boar,             | what you are doing there? | The way

n[=e]-pèk-th[=a]:  | n[=e] hèm k[=a]pel[=e] ser[=a]ràk-j[=i]." | Phàklèng [=a]lop[=o]
leave free for me: | I home want to get quickly."              | The wild boar
</pre>


<p>When a new paragraph starts in those aligned translations, please use two empty lines to indicate this.

<p>(Edited to fix a typo and to add an example of accented characters; further edited to explain the two lines rule on new paragraphs.)</BODY></HTML>
